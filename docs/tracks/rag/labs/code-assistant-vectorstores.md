# Sample Project — Code Assistant Vector Stores

This optional sample shows how to create vector stores from code/documentation for use with **watsonx Code Assistant**.

**What you need to provide:**
- Scripts that read code/docs → embeddings → vector DB
- README / usage
- `.env.sample` & config templates
- Small sample repositories/doc sets

> When ready, drop the source bundle under `create-rag-vector-stores-for-watsonx-code-assistant/` and we’ll convert it into a dedicated guide here.

# Lab 1 — Granite Overview & Playground

**Goal:** Explore Granite models and prompt patterns.

## Steps
1. Open **watsonx.ai → Prompt Lab**.
2. Select a Granite text model and try:
   - Zero-shot task (no examples)
   - Few-shot with 2–3 examples
   - System instructions vs. plain prompts
3. Save 3 prompts that work well for your use case.

## Tips
- Lower **temperature** for deterministic outputs.
- Use **few-shot** examples to reduce hallucination for structured tasks.
- Prefer **JSON-like outputs** (with validation) for downstream automation.

# Track — Granite (Models & Ecosystem)

This track focuses on **Granite foundation models** on watsonx.ai and locally.
You’ll learn model capabilities, prompt patterns, running locally (Hugging Face & Ollama),
and the watsonx.ai SDK. Bonus modules include **Text-to-SQL**, **Summarization**,
**Entity Extraction**, **Function-Calling**, and **Time-Series (TTM)**.

## Learning outcomes
- Understand Granite model families and when to use them
- Apply effective prompting and few-shot techniques
- Run Granite locally (Transformers / Ollama) and on watsonx.ai
- Use SDKs to programmatically run inference & manage prompt templates
- Build practical demos: Text-to-SQL, summarization, extraction, function-calling

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- (Recommended) IBM Cloud account & access to **watsonx.ai** (for SDK portions)

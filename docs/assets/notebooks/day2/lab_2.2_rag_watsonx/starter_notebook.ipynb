    "By the end of this lab, you will:\n",
    "- ✅ Understand how to authenticate with watsonx.ai securely\n",
    "- ✅ Use IBM Granite models for enterprise text generation\n",
    "- ✅ Create embeddings using watsonx's slate models\n",

    "2. **Compare**: How does this compare to Lab 2.1 (local RAG)?\n",
    "3. **Extend**: Add your own documents (PDFs, text files, web pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced (Optional):\n",
    "1. **Try Elasticsearch**: Replace Chroma with enterprise vector database\n",
    "2. **Add Metadata Filtering**: Search only specific document categories\n",
    "3. **Implement Hybrid Search**: Combine keyword + semantic search\n",
    "4. **Add Re-ranking**: Improve retrieval accuracy\n",
    "5. **Build a Web UI**: Create a Streamlit app for your RAG system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continue Learning:\n",
    "- **Lab 2.3**: Compare Ollama vs watsonx RAG side-by-side\n",
    "- **Lab 2.4**: Build evaluation metrics for RAG systems\n",
    "- **Day 3**: Add agents and orchestration\n",

    "## 💡 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Enterprise vs Local RAG**\n",
    "- **Local (Ollama)**: Fast, free, private, offline-capable\n",
    "- **Enterprise (watsonx)**: Scalable, governed, supported, production-ready\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **RAG Benefits**\n",
    "- ✅ Reduces hallucinations\n",
    "- ✅ Provides up-to-date information\n",
    "- ✅ Enables source attribution\n",
    "- ✅ Works with your private data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Production Considerations**\n",
    "- Security: Never hardcode credentials\n",
    "- Scalability: Use proper vector databases\n",
    "- Monitoring: Track performance metrics\n",
    "- Governance: Maintain audit logs\n",

    "## 🎯 Challenge Yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready for more? Try these challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 1: Add Your Own Documents\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Add documents about your favorite topic!\n",
    "custom_doc = Document(\n",
    "    page_content=\"Your content here...\",\n",
    "    metadata={\"source\": \"my_doc.txt\", \"category\": \"custom\"}\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 2: Experiment with Parameters\n",
    "- Try different `chunk_size` values (200, 500, 1000)\n",
    "- Adjust `k` (number of retrieved chunks)\n",
    "- Modify `temperature` in model params\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3: Compare Response Quality\n",
    "Ask the same question with different k values:\n",
    "- k=1 (single chunk)\n",
    "- k=3 (default)\n",
    "- k=5 (more context)\n",
    "\n",
    "Which gives the best answers?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🆘 Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Authentication Errors**\n",
    "- Check your `.env` file\n",
    "- Verify API key in IBM Cloud\n",
    "- Ensure Project ID is correct\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Slow Performance**\n",
    "- Normal for first run (creating embeddings)\n",
    "- Subsequent runs use cached database\n",
    "- Network speed affects watsonx calls\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Out of Memory**\n",
    "- Reduce `chunk_size`\n",
    "- Process fewer documents\n",
    "- Use batch processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Poor Answer Quality**\n",
    "- Increase `k` (retrieve more chunks)\n",
    "- Improve your prompts\n",
    "- Add more relevant documents\n",
    "\n",
